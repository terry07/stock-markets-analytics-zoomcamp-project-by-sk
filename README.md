# stock-markets-analytics-zoomcamp-project-by-sk
As participant in stock markets analytics zoomcamp, we are asked to deliver a final project whose goal is to apply everything we have learned in this course to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. The utmost ambition is to run a simulation where we can evaluate our investment strategies before apply them in practice.
