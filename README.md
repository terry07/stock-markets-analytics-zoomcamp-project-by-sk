# ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸top-24 stocks investment simulation projectðŸ“¢
As a participant in the Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp of 2025, we are required to deliver a final project that applies everything we have learned in the course to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. The ultimate goal is to run simulations that allow us to evaluate investment strategies before applying them in practice.
